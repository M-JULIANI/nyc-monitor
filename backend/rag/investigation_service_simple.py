- Severity: {alert_data.severity}/10
- Summary: {alert_data.summary}
- Sources: {', '.join(alert_data.sources)}
- Investigation ID: {investigation_state.investigation_id}
- Current Time: {current_time}

**YOUR INVESTIGATION TASKS:**

1. **INITIAL ASSESSMENT**
   - Analyze the alert severity and event type
   - Identify key investigation priorities
   - Assess potential public safety implications

2. **RESEARCH SIMULATION** (simulate what a research agent would find)
   - Historical context for this type of event at this location
   - Typical patterns and risk factors
   - Similar past incidents and their outcomes
   - Relevant NYC agencies and response protocols

3. **IMPACT ANALYSIS**
   - Transportation and traffic implications
   - Affected demographics and neighborhoods
   - Economic and social impacts
   - Duration and scope estimates

4. **COORDINATION SIMULATION** (simulate coordination tools)
   - Recommended alert status updates
   - Suggested investigation timeline
   - Required follow-up actions
   - Stakeholder notification needs

5. **EVIDENCE COLLECTION** (simulate artifact gathering)
   - Key documents or reports to review
   - Data sources to monitor
   - Witness accounts to collect
   - Physical evidence to examine

6. **FINAL ASSESSMENT**
   - Confidence level in findings (0.0-1.0)
   - Risk assessment and recommendations
   - Next steps and monitoring requirements
   - Summary of key insights
